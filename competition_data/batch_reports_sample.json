Microscopic findings: A small punch biopsy containing a fully ulcerated epidermis, with the basal epidermis not fully represented, is provided. There is a proliferation of basaloid tumor cell clusters that are partially cystically dilated and partially arranged in a palisade-like pattern at the margin. Surrounding the tumor, there is noticeable fibrosis of collagen connective tissue, accompanied by a somewhat shaky lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate. Final diagnosis: Human papillomavirus.",

Microscopic findings: A small superficial biopsy sample is provided. The epidermis is flattened and exhibits acanthotic widening at the edges, with nodular infiltrates of uniform, partially hyperpigmented melanocytes situated in the Junction Zone and extending into the upper corium. There is a subepidermal presence of actinic elastosis and numerous, partially dilated capillary vessels.",

There is distinct hyperparakeratosis with serum infiltration. Adjacent to the epidermis, there is a nodular aggregation of well-defined, non-pigmented tumor cells, which are pleomorphic, and frequently form groups and infiltrate the upper corium. Additionally, there are a few melanophages present. Critical findings: These observations are consistent with a previously diagnosed malignant melanoma. The biopsy is from a biopsy. Final diagnosis: Melanoma.",

Microscopic findings: A punch biopsy displaying a flattened epidermis, with some areas of superficial ulceration, and transitioning to a loose, basket-weave-like stratum corneum is presented. The connective tissue appears to be partially loosened, with some areas having strong edema and dilated capillary vessels. There is a scattered lymphocytic infiltration, with some areas showing very few neutrophils. Final diagnosis: Healthy skin.",
